# PIE_DeepRacer

In the framework of our third and last year at ISAE-SUPAERO, we are offered a project of several months allowing us to put into practice our technical knowledge and develop our project management skills. This Project Innovation Enterprise (PIE) is related to our study course at ISAE: Neuro-IA.

The subject we have chosen is called "Reinforcement Learning applied to autopilot", or, informally, "DeepRacer Project". It is realized in collaboration with Mr. Yves PELIGRY from the company Aikos.
